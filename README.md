# dotfiles

The dotfiles I find helpful and have modified over my years of working in the terminal. 

the deploy.sh and backup.sh files are kind of working. 

the oh-my-zsh file just runs the line from their website. I can't rember it off the top when I'm setting up a new system. so I put it there.
